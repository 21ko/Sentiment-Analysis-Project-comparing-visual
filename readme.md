# Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview
This project performs sentiment analysis on a dataset of Arabic comments and compares different visual elements using Python libraries such as **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly Express**. The dataset contains comments in Arabic, and each comment is labeled with its corresponding sentiment (e.g., `pos` for positive).

## Dataset
The dataset contains two columns: 
- `sentence`: The Arabic comment or review.
- `sentiment`: The sentiment associated with the comment (e.g., `pos` for positive sentiment).
